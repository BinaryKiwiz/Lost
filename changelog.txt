This is a changelog and will be updated whenever there is an update to the game

0.3.0 - 7/13/2020:
  Changed price multiplier of buildings from 1.25 to 1.1
  Added TimesWandered stat
  Added Playtime stat
  Added Version stat
  made all stats actually update (only playtime and timeswandered update right now because there is no way to inrcrease skill level)
  Made playtime stat show up as hours, minutes, and seconds instead of just a really big seconds number
  Changed the version numbers because they were wrong
  Next update will probably be 1.0.0, and it should have wandering implemented (not fully because there will probably be a lot more updates later), and maybe skills implemented but that probably will come later, one at a time in minor updates

  Forgot some things in last update so here they Are
  put line breaks in between skills in stats page
  Added some stuff to the 0.0.1 changelog because it wasn't complete

  Just a tiny little update, basically no new features but I like to put everything I do here
